Your goal is to quickly design, prototype, and get feedback on an application using Angular.

### Goals

Make a front-end application that:
* does a very tiny thing very well (keep it simple!)
* is thoughtfully designed
* is pleasant to use
* shows off your skills with Angular (no jQuery!)

While developing, consider:
* what is the simplist possible solution?
* how will you approach the problem so that you are always making tiny low-cost iterations?
    - Your git commit history should reflect this process
* how will you solicit feedback on your user experience and your technical approach?


### Technical Requirements

These requirements will help ensure you build an interactive prototype that demonstrates your ability with Angular.

Minimum Requirements:
* Create a front-end angular app with custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Use client-side routing to create and route to at least two different pages (each with their own view templates and controllers).

> We do not expect you to build a realistic CRUD app with a fully featured backend -- instead, we want you to prototype something of value/interest to your client so that you can quickly get critical feedback on your design and implementation *before you have invested significant resources* in the application.

If appropriate for your app, you may need or want to:
* Use an OO approach (constructors) to organize data and behaviors into classes/models.
* Use data from an external API.
* Incorporate an external angular directive like `ngDraggable` or `ngStorage` (see <a href="http://ngmodules.org">ng-modules.org</a>).
* Create a custom angular directive, model, or service.

### Scope
As usual, less is more. Keep your design simple, and execute on it well. If you have time, feel free to reach for stretch goals.

We feel a realistically scoped project could be one of the following:

* a simple game (flashcards, 20 questions, mancala)
* an api dashboard (some visualization of data, status updates, snacks)
* or a simple tool (a phonebook, notebook, or photo album)

### Deliverables

**A GitHub repository for the project with frequent commits and a README.**

**A working prototype version of your app on the master branch.**

**A working prototype version of your app deployed on Heroku or Github Pages.**

At 4pm we will have you submit, and then begin science-fair style demos of your applications.
